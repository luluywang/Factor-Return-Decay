# Death of a Factor

## Motivation

Why have factor trading strategies done so poorly over the past 10 years? Some argue the factors were never there; they were just statistical anomalies. Other argue that factors represent compensation for risk; we should still expect them to earn above average returns going forward. I believe in something between these two extremes. The factors were there, but over time more capital has entered to take advantage of these factor returns. Thus we should not expect the factor returns to be large in the future. This picture closely aligns itself with models of investor learning. Over time, investors learn about attractive investment opportunities. Then the opportunities go away.

This story, if true, would matter for several areas of our understanding of finance. First, it emphasizes that understanding "who" is investing in financial markets is important for th elevel of asset prices. As more funds, whether mutual funds or hedge funds, enter into these factor strategies, we expect the expected returns of these strategies to fall. We would need to change what we teach MBA students. These factors don't exist. The CAPM is fine for your cost of capital models. These findings matter for business strategy. Blackrock is actively rolling out new factor trading portfolios. But perhaps these portfolios are a waste of everybody's time if they're being institutionalized precisely at the point in time when they're becoming more common. Moreover, the entire literature on cross sectional asset pricing would go out the window. Why explain differences in expected returns across portfolios when the only reaosn they're there is because investors didn't know about them well enough?

It's just like they taught us at Bridgewater. Unless you know something others don't, you're not going to make money in financial markets. Or what Jonathan Berk repeatedly reminds us of: if there's nothing in scarce supply, then there can be no profits.

Are new factors dying faster?
